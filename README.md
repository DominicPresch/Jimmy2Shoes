# Jimmy2Shoes
## Motivation
This is an exploration into how to make a web application with Node.js
## Installation and Running
Clone the repository and move to the newly created directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DominicPresch/Jimmy2Shoes.git && cd Jimmy2Shoes
```
then install the dependencies with npm
```bash
npm install
```
then run the express server with the included start script
```bash
npm start
```
The app should now be visible at localhost on the default development port [8080](http://localhost:8080)
